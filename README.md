# 🚀 One-Touch Windows Setup

Clone this repo on any Windows machine. Double-click `setup.bat`. **Choose what to install** from the interactive menu — or just install everything.

It installs all your apps, dev tools, libraries, fonts, VS Code extensions, and configures Windows settings. You get full control: install everything, pick & choose, force reinstall, or preview with a dry run.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/one-touch-windows-setup.git

# 2. Double-click setup.bat (or run as admin)
cd one-touch-windows-setup
setup.bat
```

That's it. You'll see an interactive menu:

```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║           🚀  ONE-TOUCH WINDOWS SETUP  🚀           ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

  [1]  Install Everything           (all apps, tools, settings)
  [2]  Choose What to Install       (pick & choose interactively)
  [3]  Force Reinstall Everything   (reinstall even if present)
  [4]  Dry Run (Preview Only)       (see what would happen)
  [5]  Exit
```

**Option 2** lets you toggle entire categories on/off, and even **drill into** individual apps to pick exactly what you want.

## ✏️ Customize

Edit **`config.json`** to add/remove anything:

```jsonc
// Remove an app — just delete its line
// Add an app — find its winget ID with:
//   winget search "app name"

"winget_apps": {
  "browsers": [
    { "id": "Google.Chrome", "name": "Google Chrome" }
    // add more here
  ]
}
```

**Finding winget IDs:**
```bash
winget search "visual studio"
winget search "spotify"
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- Requires **Windows 10/11** with winget (comes pre-installed)
- **Admin privileges** are needed for some installs and registry changes
- Update `git_config` in `config.json` with your name/email before running
- Some changes (dark mode, registry tweaks) require a **restart** to fully apply
